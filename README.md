# -Javascript-In-The-Browser---DOM-Manipulation-Events
Project for studying


For this project i used an old assignment that i had not finished.
The project is in codepen and is a follow along tutorial by Traversy Media, i used the tutorial guidance and played around with the code.
Changed the look of it, added comments and learned some new tricks in Javascript.
